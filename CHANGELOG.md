## [1.7.0] - 2022-08-13

### Added:
- Added raycast ground check as an alternative to sphere ground check.

- Added support for player input in input system component.

### Changes:
- Revamped how Gold Player project settings are saved. Old settings will be upgraded.
- Changed Drain Stamina When and Kick When to flags instead for better control. Will most likely not upgrade very well if you've used these values.
- Mouse Sensitivity and Mouse Damping have been renamed to Look Sensitivity and Look Damping.
- All virtual methods and protected fields have been turned private.

## [1.6.0] - 2020-09-06

### Added:
- Added Gold Player Animator for easy and simple animation support.
- Added Gold Player Graphics that can be used to easily control the graphics visibility on the player.

- Added Gold Player Object Bob that allows you to assign multiple objects to bob as the player moves.
- Added a custom editor for Gold Player Input System and Gold Player Input.
- Added support for disabling certain components using scripting define symbols and also through project settings (2018.3+).
- Added support for Cinemachine.
- Added support for both Text and TextMeshProUGUI on Gold Player UI, no matter the version. (But TMP is still 2018.1+!). **WILL BREAK YOUR UI WHEN UPGRADING!**
- Added new examples, both in Unity package and package manager version.
- Added support for jumping to require stamina.
- Added support for different stamina regen rates depending on if the player is moving or not.

### Improvements:
- When creating a player through 'GameObject - 3D - Gold Player Controller', it now fills in audio clips if the standard ones are present.
- Player Audio Behaviour can now handle audio by itself instead of it always being handled by Gold Player.
- Unity 2019.3+ is no longer a requirement for the new input system to function. As long as it's enabled and present, Gold Player will adapt to it.

- Improved code stripping. It now strips out all obsolete methods and properties to minimize code size.
- Added more safety checks and also make sure they get stripped out on release builds to improve performance.
- Several quality of life improvements.

### Changes:
- **(BREAKING CHANGE)** Minimum supported version raised to 2018.4. Gold Player will still probably work on version below but issues with versions below 2018.4 may not be fixed or take longer to fix.
- Made `MovementInput`, `SmoothedMovementInput`, `ShouldJump`, `ShouldRun`, and `ShouldCrouch` public to be able to control movement through code.
- Input actions are now directly referenced instead of just using the whole input actions asset.
- Changed folder structure to match the same structure of packages.
- Removed all sub-menus (except for example scripts) for Gold Player scripts in the 'Add Component' menu.
- (**BREAKING CHANGE**) Removed all sub-namespaces from scripts. All Gold Player scripts are now in `Hertzole.GoldPlayer`. Your code may break if you've referenced Gold Player in code but you mostly only need to remove old namespaces.

- Changed wording on Run/Crouch Toggle modes. Off -> Hold, Permanent -> Toggle
- Changed wording on running modes. Faster Than Run Speed -> Is Running.
- Removed `GOLD_PLAYER_INTERACTION` script define. **It's now recommended you ONLY remove components using project settings/script defines**.

### Fixes:
- Fixed head bob strafe tilt still being applied even when the player can't move.
- Fixed mouse sensitivity being used twice when multiplying. **NOTE: May be a breaking change in user experience!**
